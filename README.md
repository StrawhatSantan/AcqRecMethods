# Acquisition and Reconstruction Methods Labs

This repository contains Labs sessions for Acquisition and Reconstruction Methods course for the Image Processing and Computer Vision Masters Programme at University of Bordeaux. The labs involve various tasks related to gaze fixation density maps, explanation methods, and model evaluation. Below is an overview of the labs conducted:

## Lab 1 & 2: Introduction and working with X-ray and Tomography

- Loading the Shepp-Logan Phantom
- Using Radon and Inverse Radon transforms to go from phanatom to sinogram and vice versa
- Hyperparameter tuning: number of projection, projection angles etc
- Filtered back projection and Iterative reconstruction methods

## Lab 3: Visualization of MR Images

- Working with MR Images and DICOM files
- Normalization methods and intensity profiles of MR Images

## Lab 4: Exploring 3D images, windows, and views of MR Images

- Exploration of different views / slices of MR Images
- Advanced normalization techniques
- Working with Nifti files

## Lab 5: Disparity and depth map estimation

- Estimation of disparity maps using OpenCV's steroBM stereoSGBM
- Estimation of depth map from RGB image using two SOTA models.

## Lab 6: Point clouds and meshes

- Visualizing and loading point clouds from pg3m files
- Extraction of surfaces using Marching cube algorithm

## Structure of the Repository

- Each lab is organized in its respective directory.
- Detailed instructions, code, and documentation for each lab are available within their corresponding directories.
